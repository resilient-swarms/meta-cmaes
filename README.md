# meta-cmaes
learning behaviour-performance map with meta-cmaes


installation instructions:

1. Go to https://github.com/AranBSmith/MAP-Elites-Rhex and follow the instructions. Before installing make sure that:


A. Make sure you have python2.7 as the default because there will be some "print X" statements (print(X) must be used in py3.x) in the ./waf scripts. Check the current version of python, if it is python 3, then you can either install an environment or alias python2.7 in your bashrc.

If you don't have an environment yet, do:

        conda create --name py2.7 python=2.7

Then activate the py2.7 environment before doing the install: 

        conda active py2.7


alternatively you can add to your ~/.bashrc:


        alias python=/usr/local/bin/python2.7

B. When installing the rhex_common files, replace the rhex_common/rhex_controller/rhex_controller_buehler.hpp file with the 'rhex_controller_buehler.hpp'  included in this project:


        cd ${RESIBOTS_DIR}/include/meta-cmaes

        cp -f rhex_controller_buehler.hpp ~/rhex_common/rhex_controller/include/rhex_controller/



2. Set the correct values for the environment variables ${RESIBOTS_DIR} and ${SFERES_DIR} in your .bashrc file

3. Clone the meta-cmaes folder

    
        git clone https://github.com/resilient-swarms/meta-cmaes.git



and then clone MAP-ElitesRhex to your sferes experiment folder:

        cd ${SFERES_DIR}/exp

        git clone https://github.com/resilient-swarms/MAP-Elites-Rhex




4. A. Compiling the META-learning conditions:

        export BUILD_META=True

   B. Compiling the control conditions does not require this export, or you can be explicit and write:

        export BUILD_META=False 


5. Two other optional settings are the number of cores, e.g.,


        export NUM_CORES=16


and whether or not to visualise the results True/False


        export BUILD_GRAPHIC=True


6. To compile, do:


        bash scripts/make.sh


   This will generate either 2 binaries (the two meta-learning conditions) or 4 binaries (the control-conditions), depending on BUILD_META.

   Note that, when you have already compiled the binaries before and changed the code, you need to use

        bash scripts/make_update.sh

   


7. To run, use the binary path obtained from the compilation, and add the replicate_number and the folder where you want to store the results.

   Please use the following template for the different conditions:

i) DAMAGE_META:

        mkdir ${RESULTS_DIR}/damage_meta
        mkdir ${RESULTS_DIR}/damage_meta/exp${replicate_number}
        ${SFERES_DIR}/build/exp/MAP-Elites-Rhex/rhex_metaCMAES_damage_meta_binary ${replicate_number} --d ${RESULTS_DIR}/damage_meta/exp${replicate_number} >> ${logfile}

ii) ENVIR_META:

        mkdir ${RESULTS_DIR}/envir_meta
        mkdir ${RESULTS_DIR}/envir_meta/exp${replicate_number}
        ${SFERES_DIR}/build/exp/MAP-Elites-Rhex/rhex_metaCMAES_envir_meta_binary ${replicate_number} --d ${RESULTS_DIR}/envir_meta/exp${replicate_number} >> ${logfile}
    

iii) RANDOM:

        mkdir ${RESULTS_DIR}/random
        mkdir ${RESULTS_DIR}/random/exp${replicate_number}
        ${SFERES_DIR}/build/exp/MAP-Elites-Rhex/rhex_metaCMAES_random_binary ${replicate_number} --d ${RESULTS_DIR}/random/exp${replicate_number} >> ${logfile}

iv) DUTY_CYCLE:

        mkdir ${RESULTS_DIR}/duty
        mkdir ${RESULTS_DIR}/duty/exp${replicate_number}
        ${SFERES_DIR}/build/exp/MAP-Elites-Rhex/rhex_metaCMAES_duty_binary ${replicate_number} --d ${RESULTS_DIR}/duty/exp${replicate_number} >> ${logfile}

    
v) BODY_ORIENTATION:

        mkdir ${RESULTS_DIR}/bo
        mkdir ${RESULTS_DIR}/bo/exp${replicate_number}
        ${SFERES_DIR}/build/exp/MAP-Elites-Rhex/rhex_metaCMAES_bo_binary ${replicate_number} --d ${RESULTS_DIR}/bo/exp${replicate_number} >> ${logfile}

        
vi) LINEAR_VELOCITY:

        mkdir ${RESULTS_DIR}/lv
        mkdir ${RESULTS_DIR}/lv/exp${replicate_number}
        ${SFERES_DIR}/build/exp/MAP-Elites-Rhex/rhex_metaCMAES_lv_binary ${replicate_number} --d ${RESULTS_DIR}/lv/exp${replicate_number} >> ${logfile}



8. To assess the final archives, do as follows:

8A. Assessing train performance

8A.1 build the test:

        export NUM_CORES=8
        export BUILD_TRAIN=True
        bash scripts/make.sh
        

8A.2 run the test:

        bash scripts/train_recovery.sh  ${outputfolder} ${methods} ${test_type} ${replicates}

For example, 

        bash scripts/train_recovery.sh ${RESULTS_DIR} random "envir damage" david55

that is, $methods is the type of method in (bo, duty, lv, or random); $test_type is the type of adaptation test (damage and/or envir); $replicates is the identifier of your run (e.g., 1,2, or 3 is common). in this case "envir damage" is provided together, resulting in CPU usage twice NUM_CORES; alternatively, you can use 16 (or any number of cores) and apply just a single program by providing  for example:

        bash scripts/train_recovery.sh ${RESULTS_DIR} random "envir" 1

The runs generate files named as "envir_trainperformance" and/or "damage_trainperformance" where applicable (in the $RESULTS_DIR/$condition/exp$replicates folder).

8B. Assessing test performance

8B.1 Build the test :

        export NUM_CORES=8
        export BUILD_TEST=True
        bash scripts/make.sh


8B.2 Run the test:

        bash scripts/test_recovery.sh ${RESULTS_DIR} ${methods} ${test_type} ${replicates}

For example, 

        bash scripts/test_recovery.sh ${RESULTS_DIR} random "envir damage" david55

that is, $methods is the type of method in (bo, duty, lv, or random); $test_type is the type of adaptation test (damage and/or envir); $replicates is the identifier of your run (e.g., 1,2, or 3 is common).

These runs generate files named as "envir_performance" and/or "damage_performance" where applicable (in the $RESULTS_DIR/$condition/exp$replicates folder).


The above test runs will assess performance averaged across all damages. To test the maximal performance on each task, do the make script with the setting


	export BUILD_INDIVIDUAL_DAMAGE=True && export BUILD_TEST=True
	bash scripts/make.sh


Note that there is also a test with cmaes from scratch for this setting. This can be done as follows:

        bash scripts/test_recovery.sh ${RESULTS_DIR} cmaescheck damage david55 0

where the final number 0 is the index of the damage in the damage_set


8C. Assessing cross-domain transfer
8C.1 Install the test performance script (see 8B.1-2)
8C.2 Run the test:

         bash scripts/transfer_recovery.sh ${outputfolder} ${methods} ${test_type} ${replicates}
